\f0\fs28 \cf0 Folks,\
\
Attached you will find all the fonts to install on your newsroom computers. Please don\'92t use these fonts or any of the templates until the redesign launches in your market. You can start updating pieces (business cards, stationary, house ads), but please don\'92t use this in your paper or any other public-facing product.\
\
Here is the breakdown of who can get what fonts in your newsroom (they are very expensive, so we don\'92t have enough licenses to cover every ACBJ employee throughout the entire company):\
\

\b Acta families (Serif, 20 licenses per newsroom) -> 
\b0 Everyone can have these (publisher, reporters, editors, designers, etc.)\
\

\b Graphik families (Sans serif, 10 licenses per newsroom) ->
\b0  This should only go to publisher, editors, designers and researcher\
\

\b Guardian Agate Sans (Agate, 5 licenses per newsroom) ->
\b0  This should only go to publisher, editors, designers and researcher\
\
Holler if you have any questions!\
